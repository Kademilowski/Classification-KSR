    WASHINGTON, June 15 - 

U.S. exporters will have the opportunity to sell 170,000 tonnes of wheat to West African countries under the Export Enhancement Program, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     It said in addition to Benin, Cameroon, Ivory Coast, Ghana and Togo, four more countries -- Burkina Faso, Gabon, Liberia and Niger -- have been declared eligible under the initiative.     The export sales will be subsidized with commodities from the inventory of the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC), it said.     West African countries have already purchased 129,500 tonnes of wheat under previously announced export bonus programs, it noted.  Reuter &#3;
