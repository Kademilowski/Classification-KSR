PERU FAILS TO BUY SUGAR AT WEEKEND TENDER

    LONDON, April 27 - 

Peru failed to conclude any purchases at its weekend buying tender for two cargoes June shipment white sugar owing to the sharp price rise that day, traders said.     However, the country had bought whites last week at 202.90 dlrs a tonne cost and freight for May/June, they said.     Meanwhile there was no news of the recent tender quest by Algeria for 30,000 whites, the traders said.  Reuter &#3;
