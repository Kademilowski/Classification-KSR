INDONESIA DENIES GIVING PALM OIL IMPORT LICENCES

    JAKARTA, March 14 - 

Indonesia, the world's second largest producer of palm oil, has not issued licences to import the commodity, a spokesman for the Ministry of Trade said.     Traders in London said Indonesia has issued licences to local operators to import around 135,000 tonnes of palm oil starting in April, but the spokesman said this was incorrect.     A spokesman for the Indonesian Importers Association also denied knowledge of the import plan. He said importers would quickly know if licences were issued. The Trade Ministry official said there was no sign of a palm oil shortage in Indonesia.  REUTER &#3;
