WHITE HOUSE DECLINES COMMENT ON DOLLAR'S SLIDE

    WASHINGTON, April 27 - 

White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater declined to comment on the continuing slide of the dollar against the Japanese yen, but said Treasury Secretary James Baker was watching developments.     "Jim Baker is monitoring that at the Treasury Department, but at this point we don't have any comment to make on the dollar," Fitzwater told reporters.     He was asked at a briefing whether the White House was concerned about the continuing decline in the dollar's value.  Reuter &#3;
