WHITE HOUSE SAYS TAX INCREASE NOT NEEDED

    WASHINGTON, March 5 - 

The White House said a tax increase is not needed to reduce the federal budget deficit.     "We think that's certainly unnecessary. We are opposed to tax increases," spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.     House Speaker Jim Wright told Budget Committee Democrats Wednesday he would fight for a tax increase this year to reduce the deficit.     Fitzwater said the administration believed its budget would show the way to get the deficit down without a tax rise "and that's our course."  Reuter &#3;
