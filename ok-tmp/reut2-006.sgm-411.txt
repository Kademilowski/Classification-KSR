EGYPT REJECTS VEG OIL OFFERS, TO RETENDER

    LONDON, March 18 - 

Egypt rejected all offers at a vegetable oil import tender yesterday for unspecified amounts of sunflowerseed oil and/or cottonseed oil, traders said. It has asked for a renewal of offers on March 24.     Exporters said they were not prepared to offer material on Egypt's new landed contract terms which include a clause, "free from radioactive contamination." Offers submitted were on old contract terms, all of which were rejected.  REUTER &#3;
