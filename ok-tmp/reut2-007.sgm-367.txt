    NEW YORK, March 19 - 

U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani said Boyd Jefferies, former chairman of Jefferies Group Inc <JEFG>, is cooperating with an investigation into violations of U.S. securities laws.     The Jefferies firm said earlier today that Boyd Jefferies resigned and intends to plead guilty to two felony counts.     Giuliani's written statement said one count will relate to a criminal violation of margin requirements and the second will relate to aiding and abetting the falsification of the records of a brokerage house controlled by Ivan Boesky.
