SAUDI ARABIA WANTS TO INCREASE OIL SALES TO JAPAN

    TOKYO, April 17 - 

Saudi Arabia hopes to increase the volume of its oil exports to Japan through expanding bilateral trade, Saudi Arabian Interior Minister Naif bin Abdul-Aziz said.     He told a Tokyo reception his country hopes to raise crude and products exports to Japan to earlier levels, but did not elaborate. To promote trade, Saudi Arabia is inviting Japanese industries to do business there, he said.     Japanese firms now have long-term contracts to import a total of 150,000 barrels per day of Saudi crude.  REUTER &#3;
