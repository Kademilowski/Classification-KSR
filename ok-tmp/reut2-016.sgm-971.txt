GATT TO PROBE JAPAN'S FARM IMPORT RESTRICTIONS

    TOKYO, April 21 - 

The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) will begin a probe on May 7-8 on the legality of Japanese import restrictions on 12 farm products, Agriculture Ministry officials said.     The investigation, which will take place in Geneva, follows a U.S. Complaint last year that the restrictions violated GATT rules prohibiting import quotas.     The products involved include fruit juice, peanuts and tomato juice.  Reuter &#3;
