WALL STREET STOCKS/U.S. OIL COMPANIES

    NEW YORK, March 26 - 

British Petroleum Co PLC's announcement that its U.S. subsidiary intends to tender for the 45 pct of Standard Oil Co <SRD> it does not already own, catapulted U.S. oil stocks sharply higher this morning, traders and analysts said.     "It raises the specter of additional consolidation in the industry and that is what is boosting the other oils," analyst Rosario Ilacqua of L.F. Rothschild said.     Sanford Margoshes of Shearson Lehman Brothers said "this deal shows that British Petroleum, a conservative investor that knows the oil business, is clearly confident in the U.S. oil industry, and that shines well on the U.S. companies."
