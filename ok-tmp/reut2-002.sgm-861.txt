NICARAGUA, ROMANIA, PARAGUAY LOSE TRADE RIGHTS

    WASHINGTON, March 6 - 

President Reagan formally ended preferential duty-free trade treatment for exports from Nicaragua, Romania and Paraguay under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).     He took the action after determining that the three countries are not taking steps to give their workers internationally recognized rights.     U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter had announced the intended action on January 2. The United States conducts no trade with Nicaragua and very little trade with Romania and Paraguay.
