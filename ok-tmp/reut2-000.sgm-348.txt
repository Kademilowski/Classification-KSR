GULF ARAB DEPUTY OIL MINISTERS TO MEET IN BAHRAIN

    ABU DHABI, March 2 - 

Deputy oil ministers from six Gulf Arab states will meet in Bahrain today to discuss coordination of crude oil marketing, the official Emirates news agency WAM reported.     WAM said the officials would be discussing implementation of last Sunday's agreement in Doha by Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) oil ministers to help each other market their crude oil.     Four of the GCC states - Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Kuwait and Qatar - are members of the Organiaation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and some face stiff buyer resistance to official OPEC prices.
