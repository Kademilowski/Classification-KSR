BALDRIGE WILL NOT OBJECT TO COMPUTERS FOR IRAN

    WASHINGTON, March 12 - 

Commerce Secretary Malcolm Baldrige said he would not object to the sale of computers to Iran because the technology was that of U.S.-designed personal computers developed ten years ago.     "We have no reason not to ship it," Baldrige told reporters after a Senate Banking Committee hearing on export controls.     Baldrige said the Defense Department's objection that the computers would be used in newspaper production was not a reason to bar the granting of an export license. "This is not a reason for denying it on foreign policy grounds," he said.  Reuter &#3;
