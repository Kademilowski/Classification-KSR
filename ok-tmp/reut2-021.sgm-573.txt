JAPAN/INDIA CONFERENCE CUTS GULF WAR RISK CHARGES

    HONG KONG, Oct 19 - 

The Japan/India-Pakistan-Gulf/Japan shipping conference said it would cut the extra risk insurance surcharges on shipments to Iranian and Iraqi ports to a minimum three pct from 4.5 pct on October 25.     It said surcharges on shipments of all break-bulk cargoes to non-Iraqi Arab ports would be reduced to 3.0 pct from 4.5.     A conference spokesman declined to say why the move was taken at a time of heightened tension in the Gulf.  REUTER &#3;
