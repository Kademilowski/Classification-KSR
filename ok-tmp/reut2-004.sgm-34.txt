BRITISH MINISTER CRITICISES PROPOSED EC OILS TAX

    LONDON, March 11 - 

A British minister said that a proposed European Community tax on vegetable oils and fats would raise the price of fish and chips and he pledged the government would fight against it.     Lord Belstead, a junior agriculture minister, told the House of Lords the tax would raise the price of raw materials used in many processed foods by about 100 pct.     He said revenue should not be raised by taxing the consumer and called the proposal "repugnant."  Reuter &#3;
