EC INCREASES SPECIAL FEED WHEAT TENDERS - TRADE

    LONDON, June 18 - 

The European Community (EC) has increased the size of two special export tenders for British and West German feed wheat held in intervention stores and included South Korea as an acceptable destination, traders said.     The tender was originally for 120,000 tonnes of British and 120,000 tonnes of West German feed wheat for shipment only to Poland.     But now both tranches have been increased by 50,000 tonnes to 170,000 tonnes with South Korea added as a possible destination. Both tenders are open from June 24.  Reuter &#3;
